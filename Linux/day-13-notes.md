# Day 13 – Linux Logical Volume Manager (LVM)

## 📌 Objective

Learn how Linux Logical Volume Manager (LVM) provides flexible storage management by creating, mounting, verifying, and extending Logical Volumes without repartitioning disks.

---

# Task 1 – Switch to Root User

Before performing LVM operations, switch to the root user because storage management requires administrative privileges.

## Command

```bash
sudo -i
```

## What?

Switches the current user to the root user.

## Why?

LVM commands require root privileges.

## How?

After switching, all administrative commands can be executed without using `sudo` repeatedly.

# Task 2 – Check Current Storage

Before creating LVM, check the existing disks, mounted filesystems, and current LVM configuration.

## Commands

```bash
lsblk
```

```bash
df -h
```

```bash
pvs
```

```bash
vgs
```

```bash
lvs
```

## What?

Displays available disks, mounted storage, and existing LVM configuration.

## Why?

To understand the current storage layout before making any changes.

## How?

These commands verify whether any Physical Volumes, Volume Groups, or Logical Volumes already exist.

# Task 3 – Create an EBS Volume

Created a new EBS volume from the AWS Console.

## What?

An EBS Volume is additional block storage attached to an EC2 instance.

## Why?

LVM requires additional storage devices for creating Physical Volumes.

## How?

Created a new EBS volume in the same Availability Zone as the EC2 instance.

### 📸 Output

---

# Task 4 – Attach the EBS Volume

Attached the newly created EBS volume to the EC2 instance.

## What?

Attaches storage to the running EC2 instance.

## Why?

Linux can only use a disk after it is attached.

## How?

Selected the running EC2 instance and attached the EBS volume using `/dev/sdf`.

### 📸 Output

---

# Task 5 – Verify Attached Disks

Verified that Linux detected the newly attached disks.

## Command

```bash
lsblk
```

## What?

Lists all available block devices.

## Why?

To verify that the newly attached EBS disks are visible.

## How?

The newly attached disks appeared as:

- nvme1n1
- nvme2n1
- nvme3n1

### 📸 Output

---

# Task 6 – Create Physical Volumes (PV)

Initialized the disks as Physical Volumes.

## Commands

```bash
sudo pvcreate /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 /dev/nvme3n1
```

```bash
sudo pvs
```

## What?

Converts raw disks into Physical Volumes.

## Why?

LVM can only manage disks after they become Physical Volumes.

## How?

Each attached EBS volume was initialized using `pvcreate`.

---

# Task 7 – Create Volume Group (VG)

Combined multiple Physical Volumes into one storage pool.

## Commands

```bash
sudo vgcreate rohit_vg /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1
```

```bash
sudo vgs
```

## What?

Creates a Volume Group.

## Why?

Volume Groups combine multiple disks into a single storage pool.

## How?

Combined two Physical Volumes into one Volume Group named `rohit_vg`.

### 📸 Output

---

# Task 8 – Create Logical Volume (LV)

Created a Logical Volume inside the Volume Group.

## Commands

```bash
sudo lvcreate -L 15G -n rohit_lv rohit_vg
```

```bash
sudo lvs
```

## What?

Creates a Logical Volume.

## Why?

Logical Volumes are used by applications instead of raw disks.

## How?

Allocated 15GB from the Volume Group.

### 📸 Output

---

# Task 9 – Format and Mount the Logical Volume

Created a filesystem and mounted the Logical Volume.

## Commands

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/rohit_vg/rohit_lv
```

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/rohit_lv_mount
```

```bash
sudo mount /dev/rohit_vg/rohit_lv /mnt/rohit_lv_mount
```

```bash
df -h
```

## What?

Creates an EXT4 filesystem and mounts it.

## Why?

A Logical Volume must be formatted before storing files.

## How?

Formatted using EXT4, mounted it, and verified using `df -h`.

### 📸 Output

---

# Task 10 – Verify Mounted Logical Volume

Created sample files and directories to verify the mounted storage.

## Commands

```bash
cd /mnt/rohit_lv_mount
```

```bash
mkdir rohit_devops
```

```bash
ls
```

```bash
ls -ld rohit_devops
```

## What?

Verified the mounted filesystem.

## Why?

To ensure files can be created successfully.

## How?

Created a directory and confirmed it exists.

---

# Task 11 – Extend the Logical Volume

Increased the storage capacity without recreating partitions.

## Commands

```bash
sudo lvextend -L +200M /dev/rohit_vg/rohit_lv
```

```bash
sudo resize2fs /dev/rohit_vg/rohit_lv
```

```bash
df -h /mnt/rohit_lv_mount
```

## What?

Extends the Logical Volume and resizes the filesystem.

## Why?

Applications may require additional storage as data grows.

## How?

Extended the Logical Volume by 200MB and resized the EXT4 filesystem online.
