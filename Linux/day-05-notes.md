# Day 05 – Linux Troubleshooting Runbook

## Target Service

SSH Service (ssh)

---

## Environment Basics

### 1. Check Kernel and System Information

```bash
uname -a
```

**Observation:** Verified kernel and system information.

### 2. Check OS Details

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
```

**Observation:** Confirmed Ubuntu operating system details.

---

## Filesystem Sanity

### 3. Create Temporary Directory

```bash
mkdir /tmp/runbook-demo
```

**Observation:** Directory was created successfully.

### 4. Copy and Verify File

```bash
cp /etc/hosts /tmp/runbook-demo/hosts-copy
ls -l /tmp/runbook-demo
```

**Observation:** File creation and copy operations worked correctly. Filesystem appears healthy.

---

## CPU & Memory Snapshot

### 5. Check Running Processes

```bash
top
```

**Observation:** System processes were running normally.

### 6. Check Memory Usage

```bash
free -h
```

**Observation:** Sufficient memory was available and no memory pressure was observed.

---

## Disk & Storage

### 7. Check Disk Usage

```bash
df -h
```

**Observation:** Root filesystem usage was around 74%, with enough free space available.

### 8. Check Log Directory Size

```bash
du -sh /var/log
```

**Observation:** Log directory size was normal. Some directories required elevated privileges.

---

## Network Snapshot

### 9. Check Listening Ports

```bash
ss -tulnp
```

**Observation:** SSH service was listening on port 22.

### 10. Verify Internet Connectivity

```bash
curl -I https://google.com
```

**Observation:** Internet connectivity was working correctly.

---

## Logs Reviewed

### 11. Review SSH Logs

```bash
journalctl -u ssh -n 50
```

**Observation:** Multiple connection attempts from unknown IP addresses were observed. Successful login activity for the ubuntu user was also recorded.

### 12. Review System Logs

```bash
tail -n 50 /var/log/syslog
```

**Observation:** No critical errors were found.

---

## Quick Findings

* CPU and memory usage were normal.
* Disk space was available.
* SSH service was running properly.
* Port 22 was listening.
* SSH logs showed normal activity and some external connection attempts.
* No critical issues were observed.

---

## If This Worsens

### 1. Restart the SSH service if necessary.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### 2. Review detailed logs and enable additional logging if required.

```bash
journalctl -u ssh -xe
```

### 3. Investigate resource usage and collect more diagnostic information.

```bash
top
free -h
df -h

```

## Summary

Performed a Linux troubleshooting drill on an Ubuntu EC2 instance by checking system information, filesystem health, CPU and memory usage, disk utilization, network ports, and SSH logs. Observed normal system behavior and documented the commands and findings as a reusable runbook.
